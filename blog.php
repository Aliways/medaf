                <p>No one can escape from the absolute need of technology in our daily life. Every one of us is so dependent on technology that we cannot do without them. Starting from computers to keeping fit, we require technology at every step. Technology helps us to keep in touch with people who are away from us. We use the telephones and computers to talk to them and even see them. Our daily office work is also technology based. No longer do people use the pen and paper to complete their work. We maintain our health by going to the gyms. There are machines in the gym which help us reduce our weight and keep fit. The use of technology has made our life comfortable. We cannot think of a life sans technology. We get to keep a lot of information in a small device and use it when we like. Cars have also become better with the use of technology. Thus technology is undeniably an important of our life.<br>

Technology is an absolute need we cannot escape from, it has a very big role in most aspects of our lives. In other words, it answers most of Mankind problems. Across centuries technology evolves. The importance of technology is aiming for comfort of use in whichever form it is. It always directs for easiness in life. Take the mobile technology for example. The faster the world is moving, the more hi-end the features are offered. Laptop gets thinner and smaller. It becomes more compact every year and offers more capabilities and top performance. It should load a lot of stuffs in a more concise shape. That is the need. People should not take time to think of what should be brought over a sales presentation in the southern state since everything is already "filed" in the laptop. Also for telephone. The need to be able to communicate anytime, anywhere, has inspired scientists to create cellular phone. And it gets smaller and smaller. And then it has more features, more games, more entertainment, and now offered more professional like having a computer in the pocket. And then from costly, it goes cheaper and better and faster and become more reliable. The fact that the importance of technology in our daily basis is undeniable has inspired scientists to make improvements from time to time through their invented tools and devices for us to use, just to make our lives easier. We always tend to make one step ahead. Technology can help not just with the present but also approximating the future. It can calculate the potential profits and losses. And based on these, we can create plans and a list of pre-cautious steps for the future of our descendants.<br>

               <p> UX Design is a career for you if you have relevant education, you are interested in design thinking, you want to study human’s behaviors, or you love innovation and creativity.


There is a huge competition in UX field in industry, and gaining attention in the beginning of your career requires a lot of hard work.

As mentioned by Pele, “Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.”

Below are few key points that will help you to earn recognition of your design work at very start of your job.<br>

1. Proper Planning
Whenever a task is assigned to you, plan it.

It is not necessary that someone has asked you to do it, but make it a habit to plan each assignment on your own.

To plan properly, it is essential to get clear understanding of the requirement. Divide your assignment into smaller tasks and plan each of them. This will help you to remain organized and focused towards your goal.

Provide estimates, if you are asked to do so. Sometimes, you are only informed about deadlines. It is fine. However, don’t forget to raise a red flag if deadline does not seem to be realistic. Getting delayed is not bad, but not putting up the flag at right time is considered to be your mistake.

Keep cushion for updates. Design assignments always require reviews and hence multiple iterations.

“Plan your work for today and every day, then work your plan.” — Margaret Thatcher<br>

2. Lot of Research
Keep yourself updated. You have a vast world of internet. Go to web and study relevant material.

Get inspired by beautiful designs and usable experiences. Find ideas that nurture your design skills. Look for latest trends and follow them.

There are many authentic guidelines available on internet for UI controls, interactions and layouts. You don’t have to invent things from scratch. Few examples are Google, Windows and Apple design guidelines. Pick the ones that best match with your requirements and stick to them.

The best way to earn respect is to enhance your knowledge and use it.

“Find out what’s really out there. I never said to be like me, I say be like you and make a difference.” — Marilyn Manson<br>

3. Reiteration
Good designs always take multiple iterations. Perfection cannot be achieved in a single attempt. Try again and again.

“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, try again.” — William Edward Hickson

Stakeholders will review your work. They will ask you for modifications. Sometimes the requirement changes altogether, and your entire work gets discarded, but the experience that you gain in this process will never go wasted.

Behind every pixel of design, there is a complete thinking process. And this experience helps you grow in your field.

“Few ideas work on the first try. Iteration is key to innovation.” — Sebastian Thrun<br>

4. Discontentment
Nothing can help you more than the desire to improve your work. Don’t stop trying until your craving for designing the best is satisfied.

You are the one who will decide when to stop, and no one else can tell you that you are done. Always set a level of discontent that help you to feel the urge to grow.

“Discontentment and reiteration are vital to good design.” — Sammuel Nevarez<br>

5. Extra Efforts
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra. — Jimmy Johnson

If you want to standout in your job, put extra efforts to complete your tasks. Do not limit your thinking. Go beyond the given requirements both in backward and forward directions. Give people pleasant surprises by providing something they are not expecting.

Additional efforts can take you anywhere you want to go. Most of the people do not bother going beyond the stories they are told to do. You have to go if you want to be successful.

“Believe in yourself and you will be unstoppable.” — Emily Guay<br>

6. Never Giving Up
UX design is a subjective thing. People will criticize you and your ideas. They will try to empower you with their opinions. Take their feedback positively. See what can be improved in your work.

Never give up if someone is not appreciating your efforts. Just keep on fulfilling your responsibilities efficiently. It is hard to beat a person who never gives up, and you have to be the one.

“There is no substitute for hard work. Never give up. Never stop believing. Never stop fighting.” — Hope Hicks<br>

7. Logical Reasoning
If you have knowledge and your work is based on proper research, you can easily defend your work with strong arguments.

Try to present your each point logically.

Knowledge brings confidence. Remember you are the only master of your design and no one in the room has done the research as you did.

Don’t be afraid of anyone. Your colleagues want to see you successful. They will support you if you are right. The only essential thing is to be prepared.

“Your voice can change the world.” — Barack Obama<br>

8. Being Ahead of Deadlines
Try hard to meet your deadlines. Do not prolong your tasks. It becomes very obvious and makes a bad impression.

If you are done, submit your work. Do not wait for someone to ask you for it. Work on your own deadlines. Be open to new challenges. Demand for further tasks and never sit idle.

“I’m very good at setting goals and deadlines for myself, so I don’t really need that from outside.” — Judy Blume <br>

Final Thoughts..
Above characteristics make you a responsible and reliable team member at your UX career. First impression lasts forever, unless you try to change it, so its better to work hard to earn recognition and respect in the very beginning. And remember that never spoil your positive image by losing these attributes at any time later.</p>
